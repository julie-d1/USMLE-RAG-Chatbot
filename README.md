# 🧠 USMLE-RAG-Chatbot

An AI-powered study assistant designed to support medical students preparing for **USMLE Step 1**. This chatbot uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with medical-specific embeddings and real-time LLM generation to deliver detailed, accurate, and context-aware answers to medical questions.

> 💬 Ask a question → 🔍 Search through 900+ pages of Step 1 content → 🧾 Get structured and clinically relevant answers.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **Generative AI application** that combines:

- **LangChain** for orchestration,
- **Pinecone** for fast vector retrieval,
- **Hugging Face’s MedEmbed** model for medical embeddings, and
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** for real-time, cost-effective response generation.

It offers USMLE Step 1 examinees a fast, interactive tool to enhance their study experience.

## 🩺 Features

- **Medical Query Answering**: Ask anything related to USMLE Step 1 (e.g., pathology, pharmacology, anatomy).
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Uses Pinecone to fetch relevant content chunks from curated medical PDFs.
- **Medical Embeddings**: Powered by `MedEmbed-large-v0.1`, optimized for clinical terminology.
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash Integration**: Low-latency, high-accuracy generation from Google’s GenAI models.
- **Streamlit UI**: Clean, responsive web interface.
- **Structured Responses**: Answers include summaries, comparisons, and tables when appropriate.
- **Consent Management**: Prompts users with a medical disclaimer before accessing chatbot features.
